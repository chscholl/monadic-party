          <p>Monadic Party is a five-days long Haskell summer school. Our vision is to teach in depth with each talk spanning multiple sessions. Because of the additional time at our disposal we can get deeper into each topic to show a larger part of the story behind the subject. The size will be capped at fifty attendees to provide you with a good learning experience.</p>

          <p>We will have two tracks, one for programmers that aren't experienced in Haskell and would like to learn it from the basic concepts. The other track is for people already familiar with the language and will present a selection of talks and workshops on a variety of topics. We will announce the list of topics after our call for speakers closes at the end of Febuary.</p>

          <p>We chose Poznan to host the summer school because of its architecture, culture and nightlife. The venue is a recently restored lovely old building at <a href='http://mlynska12.pl/' target='_blank'>Młynska 12</a> where we have the whole highest floor at our disposal. So the only thing you need is a ticket, laptop and a place to sleep and you're good to go. Catered lunch, tea and coffee is included in the ticket price.</p>

          <h2 class='title left'><span class='first'>G</span>etting <span class='second'>T</span>here</h2>

          <p>We will hold the summer school at <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/DMHV2GN2Nk12' target='_blank'>Młynska 12</a>, so any accommodation in the city center should be at a walkable distance from the venue. Depending on your budget and preferences, you can find places to stay on <a href='https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggJCAlhYSDNYBGi2AYgBAZgBLsIBA3gxMcgBDNgBAegBAfgBC5ICAXmoAgM&lang=en-gb&sid=f338025b520e3faeca40c7db96132554&sb=1&src=index&src_elem=sb&error_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Findex.en-gb.html%3Flabel%3Dgen173nr-1FCAEoggJCAlhYSDNYBGi2AYgBAZgBLsIBA3gxMcgBDNgBAegBAfgBC5ICAXmoAgM%3Bsid%3Df338025b520e3faeca40c7db96132554%3Bsb_price_type%3Dtotal%26%3B&ss=Pozna%C5%84&ssne=Pozna%C5%84&ssne_untouched=Pozna%C5%84&dest_id=-523642&dest_type=city&checkin_monthday=10&checkin_month=6&checkin_year=2018&checkout_monthday=15&checkout_month=6&checkout_year=2018&group_adults=1&group_children=0&no_rooms=1&genius_rate=1&from_sf=1' target='_blank'>Booking.com</a>, <a href='https://www.hostelworld.com/search?search_keywords=Poznan%2C+Poland&country=Poland&city=Poznan&date_from=2018-06-10&date_to=2018-06-15&number_of_guests=1' target='_blank'>Hostelworld</a> or <a href='https://pl.hotels.com/search.do?resolved-location=CITY%3A1053596%3AUNKNOWN%3AUNKNOWN&destination-id=1053596&q-destination=Pozna%C5%84,%20Polska&q-check-in=2018-06-10&q-check-out=2018-06-15&q-rooms=1&q-room-0-adults=2&q-room-0-children=0' target='_blank'>Hotels.com</a>.

          <p>In terms of travel, <a href='https://wizzair.com' target='_blank'>WizzAir</a>, <a href='https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en/' target='_blank'>Ryanair</a>, <a href='https://www.lufthansa.com/uk/en/Homepage' target='_blank'>Lufthansa</a> and <a href='http://www.lot.com/gb/en' target='_blank'>LOT</a> all have a dense network of daily connections to and from the city. It would be wise to try a flight aggregator like <a href='https://www.momondo.com/' target='_blank'>Momondo</a> or <a href='https://www.google.com/flights/' target='_blank'>Google Flights</a>. There are frequent train connections from Germany and inside Poland, so please choose these if you want to travel in a way more friendly to the environment. Bus transport is also an option on <a href='http://www.polskibus.com/en/index.htm' target='_blank'>PolskiBus</a> which operates a lot of routes in the region.</p>

          <p>Inside the city of Poznan there is a good <a href='http://www.ztm.poznan.pl/en/#planner' target='_blank'>public transporation system</a> with a dense network throughout the city.</p>

              <p>We're the organizers of <a href='https://www.meetup.com/Monadic-Warsaw/' target='_blank'>Monadic Warsaw</a>, Ewa Kruzynska and Michal Kawalec. With over five hundred members it grew up to be one of the biggest Haskell meetups in Europe. We've had speakers and visitors from all over the world and we also run a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCeiYYR2fCXarkfSqqFBwuA' target='_blank'>YouTube channel</a>. It is our way of popularizing functional programming and building a community of interested people. We are sure the summer school will give us as much fun as Monadic Warsaw.

            <p>Do you want to lead workshops at the summer school? We need you to be a speaker at our event.</p>
            
            <p>We are looking for people interested in leading workshops spanning three to six slots on various topics in the Haskell ecosystem. Slots take fifty minutes and can be allocated together or spread over a couple days, depending on your preference. We will be having two tracks, a beginners one that aims to cater to programmers that might not have experience with Haskell and advanced for people who know and understand it and want to learn new concepts. We will cover your travel and accommodation costs.</p>
