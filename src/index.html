          <p>Monadic Party is a five-days long Haskell summer school. Our vision is to teach in depth with each talk spanning multiple sessions. Because of the additional time at our disposal we can get deeper into each topic to show a larger part of the story behind the subject. The size will be capped at fifty attendees to provide you with a good learning experience.</p>

          <p>We will have two tracks, one for programmers that aren't experienced in Haskell and would like to learn it from the basic concepts. The other track is for people already familiar with the language and will present a selection of talks and workshops on a variety of topics. We will announce the list of topics after our call for speakers closes at the end of February.</p>

          <p>We chose Poznan to host the summer school because of its architecture, culture and nightlife. The venue is a recently restored lovely old building at <a href='http://mlynska12.pl/' target='_blank'>Mlynska 12</a> where we have the whole highest floor at our disposal. So the only thing you need is a ticket, laptop and a place to sleep and you're good to go. Catered lunch, tea and coffee is included in the ticket price.</p>

          <h2 class='title left'><span class='first'>G</span>etting <span class='second'>T</span>here</h2>

          <p>We will hold the summer school at <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/DMHV2GN2Nk12' target='_blank'>Mlynska 12</a>, Poznan, Poland. The venue is in the Old Town, a walking distance from a town square. We would love to help you with choosing a place to stay. If you have any questions, please email us at <a href='mailto:team@monadic.party'>team@monadic.party</a>.</p>

          <p>In terms of travel, <a href='https://wizzair.com' target='_blank'>WizzAir</a>, <a href='https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en/' target='_blank'>Ryanair</a>, <a href='https://www.lufthansa.com/uk/en/Homepage' target='_blank'>Lufthansa</a> and <a href='http://www.lot.com/gb/en' target='_blank'>LOT</a> all have a dense network of daily connections to and from the city. If you want to save some carbon dioxide, there are frequent train connections from Germany and inside Poland. Buses are also a good budget option with <a href='http://www.polskibus.com/en/index.htm' target='_blank'>PolskiBus</a> which operates a lot of routes in the region.</p>

          <p>Inside the city of Poznan there is a good <a href='http://www.ztm.poznan.pl/en/#planner' target='_blank'>public transporation system</a> with a dense network throughout the city.</p>

              <p>We're the organizers of <a href='https://www.meetup.com/Monadic-Warsaw/' target='_blank'>Monadic Warsaw</a>, Ewa Kruzynska and <a href='https://twitter.com/monad_cat' target='_blank'>Michal Kawalec</a>. With over five hundred members it grew up to be one of the biggest Haskell meetups in Europe. We've had speakers and visitors from all over the world and we also host a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCeiYYR2fCXarkfSqqFBwuA' target='_blank'>YouTube channel</a>. It is our way of popularizing functional programming and building a community of interested people. We are sure the summer school will give us as much fun as Monadic Warsaw.

              <p>We are deligted to offer a means based scholarship programme. If you are financially unable to attend the summer school, we have a number of fully funded places available. Everything needed for you to attend is covered - travel to the event, accommodation and the ticket itself. The scholarships are provided by <a target='_blank' href='https://x-team.com'>X-Team</a></p>

Right now I’m collecting novel algorithmic and mathematical problems in their native industrial habitat, they’re quite fun to spot in their natural unformalized state. Later I think I shall climb back into my tower and analyze them in the laboratory.

                <h4>A Category Theory course</h4>
                <div class='bio'>
We will present an introduction to Category Theory for a Haskell
programmer.  We will introduce basic notions of category theory together
with their counterparts in Haskell.  We will try to fill the course with
interesting and useful examples taken from both worlds: of pure
mathematics and Haskell.  We will introduce the notions of category
theory, functors and natural transformations, universal properties and
adjoint functors.  We will consider initial objects, and the notion of
freeness.  If time permits we will show how initial F-algebras give rise
to recursive schemes in an elegant an elementary way and how GADTs can
be constructed via Yoneda Lemma.

                <h4>Deploying Haskell to the Cloud</h4>
                <div class='bio'>
                  I want people to walk away feeling confident that they're capable of deploying Haskell apps to a server. So in the first half or so we'll install nix, use nix-deploy to get a demo app running, and learn enough about nix to get a sense of what's going on. In the second half I'd like to iterate on that with a real life project project.

                <h4>Web development with Servant and ReasonML</h4>
                <div class='bio'>
                    Haskell specifically and functional programming in general brings many promises to the table in web development. In this series of workshops and lectures I will present how reliable and fun it can be. We will write servers with Servant and interfaces in ReasonML. The intention is for attendees to leave with enough knowledge to easily write common web services in a typesafe manner. On the frontend side we will learn how ReasonML can help with creating robust interfaces we can rely on and reason about.<br /><br />

                    This tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with web development in any technology and an intermediate knowledge of Haskell.

                <h4>A Gentle Introduction to Profunctors</h4>
                <div class='bio'>
                    Over the course of the week, we'll work on gaining a deep understanding of Haskell's type and typeclass system and how they allow us to think about code algebraically. We'll explore functors in great detail, coming to understand the similarities and differences of the most important functors, ending with a look at contravariant functors, profunctors, and how profunctors are used to great effect in the SQL-generating library, `opaleye.`

                <h4>An Introduction to Dependent Types</h4>
                <div class='bio'>
                    This will be a gentle conceptual introduction to dependent types. I'll cover motivation, how well-known constructions generalize to dependent types, using types to guide program writing, dependent pattern matching, constructivism and the law of excluded middle, code examples where dependent types fit well.
The tutorial assumes intermediate familiarity with Haskell, but otherwise requires no background about type systems.

            <h4>Deadline: 28th of February 2018</h4>

            <p>Do you want to lead workshops at the summer school? We would love to invite you to be a speaker at our event.</p>

            <p>We are looking for people interested in leading workshops spanning four to six slots on various topics in the Haskell ecosystem. Slots take fifty minutes and can be allocated together or spread over a couple days, depending on your preference. We will have two tracks, a beginners one that caters to programmers that have limited Haskell experience and advanced for people who are comfortable with the language and want to learn new concepts.</p>

            <p>Our summer school is not about making money, it's about spreading Haskell knowledge. Because of that we will cover travel and accommodation costs along with a ticket to the event for speakers.</p>
